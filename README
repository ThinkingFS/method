Insert
The insert method should set the value of the next free element to its parameter:
- The method sets the appropriate element of the array and increments currentSize; making currentSize private ensures that its value is always consistent with the state of the object. If it was public it could be directly accessed by a programmer and given an inappropriate value
- The method ensures that values are not inserted when the array is full.

Set
The set method sets the value of an element whose index is passed to the method:
-This method changes an existing value, so does nothing if the index is invalid.

Get
The get method returns the value at a given index:
- This function does not modify any member variables, so it is declared const.
- In the previous methods the approach to dealing with incorrect input was to do nothing when a method is given an index that is invalid (when it would fall outside the array, or because it does not refer to an existing element); this approach does not work for the get method since the method must return a value.
- The approach taken in this example is to return zero; it is important to understand that this is not a satisfactory solution to the problem since an existing array element could contain the value zero.
- This issue is discussed briefly under Error Handling.

Capacity and size
These functions return the size of the underlying array and the number of items currently stored in that array.
- Note that since neither function modifies the member values of the class, they are both declared const.
