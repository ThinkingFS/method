Insert
The insert method should set the value of the next free element to its parameter.
- The method sets the element at location "currentSize" in the array to "value" then increments "currentSize". Making "currentSize" private ensures that its value is always consistent with the state of the object. If it was public, it could be directly accessed by a programmer and given an inappropriate value.
- The method ensures that values are not inserted when the array is full.

Set
The set method sets the value of an element whose index is passed to the method.
- This method first finds the element at location i then sets its value to "value".
- This method changes an existing value, so it does nothing if the index is invalid.

Get
The get method returns the value at a given index.
- This method does not modify any member variables, so it is declared const.
- In the previous methods the approach to dealing with incorrect input was to do nothing when a method is given an index that is invalid (when it would fall outside the array, or because it does not refer to an existing element). Such approach does not work for the get method since the method must return a value.
- The approach used in this method is to return zero. This approach is not a satisfactory solution to the problem since an existing array element could contain the value zero.
- This issue is discussed briefly under Error Handling.

Capacity and size
These functions return the size of the underlying array and the number of items currently stored in that array.
- Since neither function modifies the member values of the class, they are both declared const.
